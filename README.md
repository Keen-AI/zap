## About

Zap is a lightweight wrapper around Pytorch Lightning and MLFlow. It allows you to quickly train and test models for **classification**, **object detection** and **segmentation** without writing tonnes of boilerplate code.

#### Supported models

| Model    | Type             | Import Path                          |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| ResNet34 | Classification   | `zap.classification.models.ResNet34` |
| UNet     | Segmentation     | `zap.segmentation.models.UNet`       |
| YOLO     | Object Detection | `zap.object_detection.models.YOLO`   |

## How To Guide

#### Installation

```
pip install -e TODO
```

#### Set up

Using Zap is super simple. There are 2 key steps:

- Create the required config for your problem
- Create a Python script to call it

#### Project Structure

```
my_project/
â”œâ”€ data/
â”œâ”€ main.py
â”œâ”€ config.yaml

```

Your `data` folder will look differently depending on the type of problem you have.

#### Creating the config

Let's start with the config. Zap has already done lot of the base configuration for you. We just need to tell it 3 things:

- the model we want to use
- the data we want to load
- the optimizer we want to use

Create a `.yaml` file for your configuration. Let's define the model first. For a list of available models, see the Available Models section.

```yaml
model:
  class_path: zap.classification.models.ResNet34
  init_args:
    num_classes: 12
    bias: true
```

Now, in the same file, let's define the data source. We're also going to define:

- transforms (in this example, `ToTensor` and `Resize` to `32x32`)
- our train, test, val splits
- our batch size (and a few other typical Pytorch settings)

```yaml
data:
  class_path: zap.classification.data_modules.ClassificationDataModule
  init_args:
    data_dir: <YOUR_DATA_DIR> # see project structure section
    transforms:
      - class_path: torchvision.transforms.ToTensor
      - class_path: torchvision.transforms.Resize
        init_args:
          size:
            - 32
            - 32
          antialias: true
    train_split: 0.7
    test_split: 0.2
    val_split: 0.1
    batch_size: 64
    num_workers: 0
    pin_memory: true
    shuffle: true
```

And finally let's define our optimizer. In this example we'll use `Adam` with a learning rate of 0.001. For more optimizers you can explore the `torch.optim` module (or Pytorch docs), **but keep in mind that the Stochastic Weight Averaging technique does not support all optimizers.**

```yaml
optimizer:
  class_path: torch.optim.Adam
  init_args:
    lr: 0.001
    betas:
      - 0.9
      - 0.999
    eps: 1.0e-08
    weight_decay: 0.0
    amsgrad: false
    foreach: null
    maximize: false
    capturable: false
    differentiable: false
    fused: null
```

#### Creating the script

This is the easy part. At the bare minimum, your script needs to:

- create an instance of `Zap` and set the `experiment_name` param
- call `fit`, `test`, `predict` based on your needs

```python
from zap import Zap

z = Zap(experiment_name='my_experiment')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    z.fit()
    z.test()
    preds = z.predict()
```

#### Running

We can call our `main.py` script and give it our `config.yaml` from the command line as follows:

```
python main.py -c config.yaml
```
